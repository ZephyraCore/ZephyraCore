## 🧠 AI Modules

ZephyraCore is driven by a modular AI engine that tracks, evaluates, and forecasts blockchain risks in real time. Below are the core modules and their functions:

### 🌪️ 1. StormTrack — Dynamic Market Monitoring  
**Language:** Python

```python
def stormTrack(market_data):
    volatility_factor = abs(market_data['current_price'] - market_data['previous_price']) / market_data['previous_price']
    liquidity_factor = market_data['token_volume'] / market_data['market_liquidity']

    storm_index = volatility_factor * liquidity_factor

    if storm_index > 0.5:
        return 'Alert: High Volatility Detected'
    else:
        return 'Market Stable'
```
#### Monitors real-time market volatility and liquidity. Triggers alerts when conditions indicate elevated market risk.

### ⛈️ 2. TempestGuard — AI-Powered Risk Forecasting

```python
def tempestGuard(asset_data):
    trend_factor = asset_data['price_change'] / asset_data['previous_price']
    market_depth_factor = asset_data['market_liquidity'] / asset_data['token_volume']

    risk_prediction = trend_factor * market_depth_factor

    if risk_prediction > 0.8:
        return 'Alert: High-Risk Forecast Detected'
    else:
        return 'Risk Level Low'
```
#### Forecasts potential high-risk zones using price trends and liquidity depth metrics.

### 🌬️ 3. WindGuard — Real-Time Risk Analysis

```javascript
function windGuard(transactionData) {
  const deviationFactor = Math.abs(transactionData.priceChange / transactionData.previousPrice);
  const liquidityImpact = transactionData.tokenVolume / transactionData.marketLiquidity;

  const riskScore = deviationFactor * liquidityImpact;

  if (riskScore > 0.6) {
    return 'Alert: High Risk Detected';
  } else {
    return 'Risk Level Normal';
  }
}
```
#### Evaluates transaction-level risks based on real-time market deviation and liquidity stress.

### 🌪️ 4. GaleSync — Multi-Source Risk Detection

```javascript
function galeSync(marketData) {
  const volatilityScore = marketData.priceChange / marketData.previousPrice;
  const transactionFrequency = marketData.transactionCount / marketData.totalVolume;

  const galeRisk = volatilityScore * transactionFrequency;

  if (galeRisk > 0.7) {
    return 'Alert: Multi-Source Risk Detected';
  } else {
    return 'Market Safe';
  }
}
```
#### Combines volatility and transaction frequency to detect multi-layered market threats.

### 🌸 5. ZephyrFlow — Predictive Market Forecasting

```python
def zephyrFlow(market_data):
    price_movement = market_data['current_price'] - market_data['previous_price']
    trend_strength = abs(price_movement / market_data['previous_price'])
    volume_impact = market_data['volume_change'] / market_data['market_depth']

    forecast_score = trend_strength * volume_impact

    if forecast_score > 0.2:
        return 'Alert: Market Trend Predicted'
    else:
        return 'Market Neutral'
```
#### Predicts market trends based on price shifts, volume dynamics, and trend velocity.
